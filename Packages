Description:  Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol for IPv6 and IPv4
 with fast convergence properties. It is based on the ideas in DSDV, AODV and
 Cisco's EIGRP, but is designed to work well not only in wired networks but
 also in wireless mesh networks, and has been extended with support for
 overlay networks. Babel is an IETF standard protocol (RFC 8966).
